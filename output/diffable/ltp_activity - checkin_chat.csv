Actively checking in on one another helps to keep relationships healthy! ⭐
Ask each other questions like: “What made you happy today?” 👂 “What was difficult today?” 👂 “How can I help you?” 👂
For this to help, your children need to feel safe while sharing things with you. Be open to their responses. 💚"
msg.Older_children_,send_message,msg.Check-in_ChatAc,"Older children tend to be more honest when they trust that what they say will not be used against them later.
Be kind to yourself if your children do not want to share their problems with you. 💙 Often, children are afraid to share as they are scared they will get in trouble. Getting upset with them won’t help - keep showing you love them and give them time! 🌷"
