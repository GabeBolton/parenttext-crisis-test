Are you tired of hearing your children say yes, no, or maybe to all of your questions? Turn your chat into a game, and don’t allow one-word answers. 🎈

🔴 Older children are known to give one-word answers to avoid talking. 
💡 When you would like to really know how your children are doing, you can turn your chat into a game. 
⭐ Take turns asking each other questions. The only rule is that you cannot use one-word responses like Yes, No, Maybe, Fine, and Okay.
⚽ You can ask about things your children like or what they did today. For example, how was your day? What are you excited about? Is there anything worrying you?
🔄 It is important to let your children ask a question as well. Trust is built when your children can see that you are also sharing your life with them and not only trying to learn about their life."
