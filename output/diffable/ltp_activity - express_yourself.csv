Movement makes people happy!
This game can be played in pairs or as a group - stand facing each other or in a circle.
ðŸŽµ Together, choose a song, a fun sound, or a clapping pattern to follow and choose a person to start the game by creating one movement.
ðŸ‘€ The person to their right must copy that movement and add their own movement to it.
âœ¨ Go around the circle, each person adding a new movement."
msg._The_first_one_,send_message,msg.Express_Yoursel,"ðŸ”„ The first one who forgets someone's movements or does it in the wrong order chooses the next song, sound, or pattern and starts the game again.

ðŸŽ‰ Have fun trying out different movements together with this fun game."
