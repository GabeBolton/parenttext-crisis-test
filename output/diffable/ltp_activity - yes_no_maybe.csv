Are you tired of hearing your children say yes, no, or maybe to all of your questions? Turn your chat into a game, and don’t allow one-word answers. 🎈

🔴 Older children are known to give one-word answers to avoid talking. 
💡 When you would like to really know how your children are doing, you can turn your chat into a game. 
⭐ Take turns asking each other questions. The only rule is that you cannot use one-word responses like Yes, No, Maybe, Fine, and Okay.
⚽ You can ask about things your children like or what they did today. For example, how was your day? What are you excited about? What is one thing that is worrying you today?
🔄 It is important to let your children ask you questions as well. Trust is built when your children can see that you are also sharing your life with them and not only trying to learn about their life."
