Let’s set some goals ⭐

⏰ It can be helpful to set smaller weekly goals that are easier to reach, especially when life feels uncertain. 
 
💡Ask each of your children for one goal that they would like to achieve this week. 

🔄 Make sure this goal is *specific* and *achievable* to reach in 1 week, like: practising deep breathing for 5 minutes every day, exercising for 10 minutes three times a week, journaling feelings every night, or spending quality time with family or friends daily."

🎉 Make sure to praise and celebrate your children for their hard work towards reaching their goals.

🔔 If your children do not reach their goals, that is okay. Discuss with them the steps they still need to take or how they could reach it a different way."
