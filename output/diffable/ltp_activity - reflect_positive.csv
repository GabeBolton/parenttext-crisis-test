Spread Positivity! 🌈

💡 Together, take a minute to think about all the things you did today. 

☀️ Take turns sharing one positive or fun thing that happened. This could be something small or big, like feeling good because you cleaned the house, took a pause to take some deep breaths, learnt a new dance move, or spent time with your family and friends.

⏰ Try doing this every day - even more on the days it feels like you have not done anything special."
