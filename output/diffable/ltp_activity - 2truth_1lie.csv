This is a fun, quick game, and the point of it is to learn things about each other. Make your answers as interesting as possible! 🎨
💡 Everyone thinks of 3 facts about themselves. 2 must be true, and 1 must be a lie. 
🔷 Here are some examples: I hate cold weather, I love cold ice cream, and my favourite thing to learn about is maths.
👀 Share your facts with your children and ask them to guess which one is a lie. 
🔄 Now ask them to do the same, and guess theirs.
Did you learn anything new about your children, or did they learn anything new about you? 💛"
