Spread Hope! 

💡 Together, take a minute to think about all the things you did today. 

☀️ Take turns sharing one positive thing that happened. This could be something small or big, like feeling good because you took a pause to take some deep breaths, exercised like walking or stretching, or spent time with people you care about.

⏰ Try doing this every day - even more on the days it feels like you have not done anything special."
